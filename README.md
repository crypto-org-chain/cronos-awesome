# Cronos Ecosystem Project Template

The documentation in this repository site provides the template and specifications details to submit ecosystem projects to be included on the Cronos ecosystem page.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

[gh-cli](https://cli.github.com/)

### Getting Set Up

1. Create a new file under `/projects`. GitHub will automatically fork the repo for you.
2. Then you can submit the file. This should create a new PR for you to submit to our `main` branch.


### Fields 
1. name: `The official name of your project`
2. category: `Select up to 3 items from Categories below`
3. logo: `Url to your logo`
4. description: `Brief Project Description`
5. link: `Url to your website`
6. twitter: `Url to your Twitter`

Note: If your project belongs to more than one category, you can add each secondary category as a comma separated entry. (e.g. `["Farm", "NFT"]` etc.)

### Categories (Select up to 3 categories)
`Analytics`,
`Bridge`,
`Community & News`,
`DeFi`,
`Derivatives`,
`Dev Tool`,
`DEX`,
`Earn`,
`Gaming`,
`Infrastructure`,
`Launchpad`,
`Lending`,
`Metaverse`,
`NFT`,
`Wallet`,
`Other`

### Next Step

Once review and approved, you should see your projects on the [crypto-org-chain/cronos-awesome projects list](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos-awesome/tree/main/projects).
